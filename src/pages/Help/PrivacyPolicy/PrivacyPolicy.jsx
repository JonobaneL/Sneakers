                <h3 className={styles.title}>APPLICABILITY</h3>
                <p className={styles.info}>
                    These Terms of Sale (“Terms of Sale” or “Terms”) apply to your shopping, orders, purchases, and returns at NIKE-owned brick and mortar retail stores (each a “Retail Store”), and NIKE-owned digital stores that enable consumer purchases through NIKE.com, SNKRS or the NIKE app (each a “Digital Store”). Retail Stores and Digital Stores are collectively referred to in these Terms of Sale as “NIKE Stores”. These Terms of Sale create a legally binding agreement between you and NIKE Retail Services, Inc. (which we may refer to as “NIKE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) with its headquarters and principal place of business at One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, OR 97005, USA. NIKE may revise these Terms of Sale at any time.  The current Terms of Sale will be posted at NIKE.com.  The Terms of Sale posted at the time you purchase products at a NIKE Store will govern that purchase.  In addition to the Terms of Sale, by shopping and/or purchasing at any NIKE Store you acknowledge and agree to by bound by NIKE’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which are incorporated herein by this reference.

                <h3 className={styles.title}>NO PURCHASE FOR RESALE</h3>
                <p className={styles.info}>
                    NIKE Stores, including any consumer rights or policies offered in NIKE Stores, are intended solely for the benefit of end consumers, and therefore purchase of products for resale is strictly prohibited. Purchase for resale means the purchase of product by someone who intends to resell the product to others (consumers, businesses or any third party).  If NIKE determines that a purchase or order is intended for resale, NIKE reserves the right, in its sole discretion, and as it relates to such purchase or order, to (1) suspend the application of any NIKE policy that provides a right or benefit intended for direct to consumer purchases; and (2) take any action to hinder such purchase or order (and deter future purchases or orders), including without limitation, to restrict sales to any consumer, consumer account, or member account, cancel orders, charge restocking fees, impose purchase quantity limits, decline to issue refunds or take returns, deny access to any NIKE Store, and/or suspend or close any account.
